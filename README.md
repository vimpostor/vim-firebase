# FAQ

## How do I configure this plugin?

Please consult the extensive help page under `:help firebase-configure`.

## What's up with the name?

Similar to how [tpope](https://github.com/tpope) named the infamous Git plugin fu**git**ive, this plugin is named fi**rebase** after its main functionality. It's unfortunate (but unproblematic given the different domains) that the naming collides with an unrelated popular [Cloud API](https://firebase.google.com).
