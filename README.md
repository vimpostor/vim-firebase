# FAQ

## What's up with the name?

Similar to how [tpope](https://github.com/tpope) named the infamous Git plugin _fu_**git**_ive_, this plugin is named _fi_**rebase** after its main functionality. It has nothing to do with the unrelated popular [Cloud API](https://firebase.google.com).

## How do I configure this plugin?

Please consult the extensive help page under `:help firebase-configure`.

## Do I need to install fugitive to use this plugin?

No, fugitive is not a dependency of this plugin.
